    "Effective altruism is a philosophy and social movement that uses evidence and reasoning to determine the most effective ways to benefit others. Effective altruism (EA) encourages individuals to consider all causes and actions and to act in the way that brings about the greatest positive impact, based upon their values.\n",

    "1) look at the World Development Indicators Database to see which areas need more attention of the EA community, not just organizations but individuals willing to contribute to solving some of these challenges either through donations or working in NGOs in those areas.\n",

    "# Which countries are the poorest?\n",

    "Moral philosopher Peter Singer started his TED talk, “A Ripple Effect?” with a shocking video of a 2-year-old girl in China who was hit by a van — and then a second van — and ignored by passers-by as she lay dying in an alley. He asks of the audience: Would you have stopped and helped this girl? Not surprisingly, the unanimous response was yes. Well, every day that we don’t help others, he says, it’s like leaving this girl crippled in the alley. In 2012, Singer says, UNICEF reported that 6.9 million children under 5 died from preventable poverty-relatable diseases like malaria. Does it really matter that we’re not walking past these children in the street, that they’re far away? According to Singer, there is no morally relevant difference.\n",
