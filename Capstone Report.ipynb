    "<h3>Problem description</h3>\n",
    "I have decided to use this capstone project to address a dilemma an altruistic young human being (say, a senior year student or a recent graduate) can have: how to choose a career which would allow her or him to contribute to solving some of the world's biggest challenges? At least, some questions should come to mind:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    " \t<li>What are the world’s biggest challenges?</li>\n",
    " \t<li>How can I contribute to solve at least one of them?</li>\n",
    " \t<li>What career path should I choose to be able to contribute either financially or through research and impactful work?</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "People spend more time on their jobs than on any other activity besides sleeping—roughly 80,000 hours over the course of their lives. Choosing the right career, therefore, may be one of the most impactful things an altruistically-motivated person can do.\n",
    "In my capstone project, I have chosen to, at least, partially, address these questions.\n",
    "<h3>Data and Methodology</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I have chosen to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) look at<a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/worldbank/world-development-indicators\"> the World Development Indicators Database</a> to see which areas need more attention of the EA community, not just organizations but individuals willing to contribute to solving some of these challenges either through donations or working in NGOs in those areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll use Python to study the data and single out 20 poorest countries. I'll also look at immunization data, death rates and health expenditures. I'll use Matplotlib and Folium maps to visualize the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) scrape <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/job-board/\">the High impact job board</a> created by 80,000 Hours Initiative, geocode the data and visualize it to see where high impact jobs are available. For this I use Selenium and webdriver.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I will use Folium map not just to visualize but also to cluster job offers and see which city has more to offer for effective altuist job seeker.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having selected the city with the biggest number of offers, I will use Foursquare API to return the list of venues in the city center. I will also use Foursquare API to see which venues are trending at the moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, I will use a json of countries' coordinates and will scrape <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_African_countries_by_population\">a list of African countries from Wikipedia</a> and merge it with our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Methodology explained</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective Altruism community extensively uses statistical data to determine the most effective ways to address the biggest challenges the world currently faces. Hence, I have chosen to use the primary World Bank collection of development indicators, compiled from officially-recognized international sources. It presents the most current and accurate global development data available, and includes national, regional and global estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Python and Pandas extensively throughout our analysis. Matplotlib and Folium maps will be used for visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we will use Pandas to retrieve and structure our data. We will return a list of indicators. The list is huge and we will manually study what is available and choose the areas we will concentrate on.\n",
    "\n",
